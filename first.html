            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p> The Land Measurement Tool represents a significant advancement in the field of land surveying and management. Developed as a comprehensive software solution, this tool offers users a sophisticated platform for conducting accurate and efficient land measurements. Accessible via a user-friendly interface, the tool utilizes a combination of cutting-edge technologies, including GPS (Global Positioning System) and GIS (Geographic Information Systems), to ensure precise and reliable measurement outcomes. Key features of the Land Measurement Tool include the ability to input specific land parameters, analyze topographical data, and generate detailed measurement reports. The generated GPS coordinates will be converted into units of meter so that length of each side can be known. Heron formula is used to calculate the area of a land plotted on the Google Map. From the series of measurement, GPS measurement fall above the land</p>

            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p> When we talk about measuring land, it's all about getting it right, quickly and accurately. As more and more industries need precise information about land, using the latest technology becomes really important. So, let us introduce you to our new land measuring app – it's going to shake things up in the land assessment world.Our app combines old methods with new technology. Whether you're an experienced land surveyor, a property developer, or a scientist studying the environment, our app is designed to meet your needs with accuracy and reliability.Forget about old-fashioned tools and slow manual measurements. Our app uses smart algorithms and satellite images to give you accurate measurements in no time. With these images and data, you can understand everything about the land – its shape, borders, and what's on it – helping you make smart decisions with confidence.</p>

            <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
            <p>
                The traditional way of measuring the land is very cost effective and time consuming.  So why to measure the land by using the old methods like using measuring tape, foot count, etc. So why wasting the time on that method just use our website is  for effective result for land measurement In many regions, land measurement units vary significantly, leading to confusion and inefficiencies in property transactions. A standardized digital solution is needed to simplify land measurement, conversion, and management.
